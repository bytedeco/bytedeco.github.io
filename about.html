  <h1>About</h1>
  <h2>Samuel Audet (Author)</h2>

  <p>As my day job, I am currently working for a small company named <a href="http://fixstars.com/">Fixstars</a> in Tokyo, Japan. In Japan still, I obtained my doctor's degree (PhD equivalent) at the <a href="http://www.titech.ac.jp/english/">Tokyo Institute of Technology</a>. Previously, I did my master's degree at <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca/">McGill University</a>, and my bachelor's degree at <a href="http://www.polymtl.ca/en/">École Polytechnique de Montréal</a>, both located in Montréal, Canada. Over those years, I also had the chance to work here and there among organizations of various sizes, without finding anything that truly satisfies me. In the end, I decided to settle down for a while to prepare myself for the next phase of my life. For more information about all that, please visit <a href="http://www.ok.ctrl.titech.ac.jp/~saudet/">my personal website there</a>.</p>

  <p><em>Bytedeco</em> is a name that I came up with to give a home to my recent personal projects of <a href="https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp">JavaCPP</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets">JavaCPP Presets</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bytedeco/javacv">JavaCV</a>, <a href="https://github.com/bytedeco/procamcalib">ProCamCalib</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/bytedeco/procamtracker">ProCamTracker</a>, some of which became quite popular. Given their proven growth potential, I hope this way to extend their scope. The name reflects a few things not only about the projects, but also about my beliefs and philosophy. It could at first be interpreted as a typo of "bytecode", a technology used by Java, among others, to create portable binary executable files that, when dropped in a virtual machine, was <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/langenv-140151.html">designed to provide real gains in productivity</a>. Alternatively, it could be regarded as the stylization of a phrase like "byte decoder", hinting at some sort of process to convert data into a more usable form. It also suggests binary code decorated in a way, for example, with Java annotations, to support extra features either at build time or at runtime. Finally, one could infer an artistic desire for minimalist and elegant design, all the while accepting engineering necessities, such as thorough support for parallelization and <a href="http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/which-programs-are-fastest.php">efficient execution</a>, absolute requirements when solving compute-intensive problems, for example, audio, video, or physics processing as required by applications in the fields of graphics, multimedia, or computer vision, coinciding once again with the original governing principles behind Java technology. To be clear, I am not referring to the Java language, but the Java platform. Many other languages, for instance, Clojure, Groovy, JavaScript, Scala, Python, Ruby, or even MATLAB, can take advantage of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</p>

  <p>That said, I have an open mind. HTML5 could, for example, be considered as the new Java. However, because it does not support multithreading or allow any other language than JavaScript, because neither bytecode nor an equivalent to the Java Native Interface (JNI) have been standardized, and for other reasons as well, that is not an entirely valid comparison. Still, if HTML5 is to become an alternative to Java, we will need some way to access native C/C++ libraries easily and efficiently. In that sense, with properly standardized native functionality, I do believe there is a point in implementing something similar to JavaCPP on other platforms. Given the strong worldwide demand for talented software engineers, and the time they could save developing on more productive platforms, I hope that JavaCPP becomes a catalyst to help steer the world ever so slightly in a better direction, but this can only become a reality if it succeeds itself, first. In any case, my belief is that Java will continue to dominate a large part of the industry, for the same reasons that C/C++ still do, but at a slightly different level of abstraction.</p>
