description: Bytedeco makes native libraries available to the Java platform by offering ready-to-use bindings generated with the codeveloped <strong>JavaCPP</strong> technology. This, we hope, is the missing bridge between Java and C/C++, bringing compute-intensive science, multimedia, computer vision, deep learning, etc to the Java platform.
