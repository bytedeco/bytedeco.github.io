Samuel Audet
------------

These days, I am working full time on [Deeplearning4j](http://deeplearning4j.org/) as part of [Skymind](http://www.skymind.io/), but live in Tokyo, Japan. In Japan still, I obtained my doctor's degree (PhD equivalent) at the [Tokyo Institute of Technology](http://www.titech.ac.jp/english/). Previously, I did my master's degree at [McGill University](http://www.mcgill.ca/), and my bachelor's degree at [École Polytechnique de Montréal](http://www.polymtl.ca/en/), both located in Montréal, Canada. Over the years, I also had the chance to work here and there among organizations of various sizes, but without finding anything as exciting and as promising as what I have started to build here. Since then, Skymind has thankfully become a sponsor of this project!

For more information about some of my past activities, please visit my [now archived personal website](http://www.ok.ctrl.titech.ac.jp/res/PCS/). Also, feel free to contact me by email for any personal inquiries: [samuel.audet `at` bytedeco.org](mailto:samuel.audet at bytedeco.org)
