Samuel Audet
------------

These days, I am working full time on [Deeplearning4j](http://deeplearning4j.org/) as part of [Skymind](http://www.skymind.io/), but live in Tokyo, Japan. In Japan still, I obtained my doctor's degree (PhD equivalent) at the [Tokyo Institute of Technology](http://www.titech.ac.jp/english/). Previously, I did my master's degree at [McGill University](http://www.mcgill.ca/), and my bachelor's degree at [École Polytechnique de Montréal](http://www.polymtl.ca/en/), both located in Montréal, Canada. Over the years, I also had the chance to work here and there among organizations of various sizes, but without finding anything as exciting and as promising as what I have started to build here. Since then, Skymind has thankfully become a sponsor of this project!

For more information about some of my past activities, please visit my [now archived personal website](http://www.ok.ctrl.titech.ac.jp/res/PCS/). Also, feel free to contact me by email for any personal inquiries: [samuel.audet `at` bytedeco.org](mailto:samuel.audet at bytedeco.org)

Lloyd Chan
----------

A Software Engineer by trade, Biomedical Engineer by training, currently working on the Platform team at [M3](https://www.m3.com) in Tokyo on a revamp of front and backend systems to improve resilience, speed and maintainability of our distributed services.  Like Samuel, I'm originally from Canada and earned my engineering degree in [Engineering Science](http://engsci.utoronto.ca/) from the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/).

For the past few years, most of my development has been done in Scala, but my career began in Scheme and later on, Ruby. When I started writing a [set of blog posts](https://beachape.com/blog/2016/03/08/scala-and-opencv-ep-1-akka-webcam/) on computer vision in Scala, I realised that it was fairly difficult to start such a project due to native dependencies, so I wrote 2 plugins to make it dead simple to begin using JavaCPP and JavaCV in Scala: [SBT-JavaCPP](https://github.com/bytedeco/sbt-javacpp) and [SBT-JavaCV](https://github.com/bytedeco/sbt-javacv). I joined Bytedeco when my SBT plugins got absorbed into the organisation at Samuel's request.

Feel free to contact me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/meta_Lloyd) or [on Github](https://github.com/lloydmeta) if you have any questions for me.
